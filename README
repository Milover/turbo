								DESCRIPTION
\*---------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

Under construction :D



/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------*\
								DEPENDENCIES
\*---------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

The following are dependencies to build the sources:

	CMake (v3.2 or higher)
	Gmsh (v4.4 or higher)
	Doxygen (v1.8 or higher) - for documentation only


	Linux:

If building on Linux machines both CMake and Gmsh are available as packages
from the repositories:

	cmake
	libgmsh-dev
	doxygen

Alternatively see instructions for Mac machines for piecewise building.
Once installed see the Building section for the build procedure.


	Mac:

If building on Mac machines the CMake binary (and sources) is available at
the following website:

	cmake.org

Once installed make sure CMake is added to the local search path by adding
the following line to your ~/.bash_profile:

	PATH="/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin":"$PATH"

The Gmsh sources and the SDK kit is available at the following website:

	gmsh.info

The simplest way to meet the prerequisites is to download the SDK kit and then
simply move the gmsh library ('libgmsh.[version].so' or
'libgmsh.[version].dylib) to '/usr/local/lib' and the gmsh header ('gmsh.h')
to '/usr/local/include'. After this is done proceed to the Building section.

If building gmsh from source follow the build instructions for building the
gmsh dynamic library and then install the library and the headers.

Doxygen is available at ...

								BUILDING
\*---------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

The 'turbo' sources are available at the following repositories:

	github.com/Milover/turbo
	bitbucket.com/Milover/turbo

Either clone or download them and then execute the following commands:

	$ cd turbo
	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../
	$ make

If you would like to build the documentation (requires Doxygen) as well:

	$ make doc

Note that the documentation is built in the 'doc' directory and requires to be
subsequently built via latex:

	$ cd ../doc/latex
	$ pdflatex turbo.latex

To run the test simply run:

	$ ctest

from the build directory. Note that the test are built in 'test/bin' as
standalone binaries and can be run individually. To suppress all output,
including the gmsh gui, but the test result simply run them with the
'--result-only' command line flag.
